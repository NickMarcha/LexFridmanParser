# Lex Fridman Parse
Warning, very scrappy hastely made in less than 2 hours.

Goal was to parse timestamps and gather some word statistics like speaking time wordcount etc from the 5 speakers in [this transcript](https://lexfridman.com/israel-palestine-debate-transcript/).
It works in at a very basic level, I included the downloaded html as an example, I imagine it should work for any transcript available on Lex Fridman's site. 

Seemed to abe 95% acurate compared to a seperate analysis created by [r/shoehorn_stable](https://www.reddit.com/user/shoehorn_staple/), their approach was AI voice to text transcription as far as I'm aware.
