            <span class="ts-text">The following is a debate on the topic of Israel and Palestine with Norman Finkelstein, Benny Morris, Mouin Rabbani and Steven Bonnell, also known online as Destiny. Norm and Benny are historians. Mouin is a Middle East analyst. And Steven is a political commentator and streamer. All four have spoken and debated extensively on this topic. The goal for this debate was not for anyone to win or to score points. It wasn&#8217;t to get views or likes. I never care about those. And I think there are probably much easier ways to get those things if I did care.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The goal was to explore together the history, present and future of Israel and Palestine in a free flowing conversation. No time limits, no rules. There was a lot of tension in the room from the very beginning, and it only got more intense as we went along. And I quickly realized that this very conversation in a very real human way was a microcosm of the tensions and distance and perspectives on the topic of Israel and Palestine. For some debates, I will step in and moderate strictly to prevent emotion from boiling. For this, I saw the value in not interfering with the passion of the exchanges because that emotion in itself spoke volumes.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">We did talk about the history and the future. But the anger, the frustration, the biting wit, and at times, respect and comradery were all there. Like I said, we did it in an perhaps all too human way. I will do more debates and conversations on these difficult topics and I will continue to search for hope in the midst of death and destruction, to search for our common humanity in the midst of division and hate. This thing we have going on, human civilization, the whole of it is beautiful and it&#8217;s worth figuring out how we can help it flourish together. I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

            <span class="ts-text">First question is about 1948/ for Israelis, 1948 is the establishment of the state of Israel and the war of independence. For Palestinians, 1948 is the Nakba, which means catastrophe or the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes as a consequence of the war. What to you is important to understand about the events of 1948 and the period around there, &#8217;47, &#8217;49, that helps us understand what&#8217;s going on today and maybe helps us understand the roots of all of this that started even before 1948. I was hoping that Norm could speak first, then Benny, then Mouin, and then Steven. Norm?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">After World War II, the British decided that they didn&#8217;t want to deal with the Palestine question anymore and the ball was thrown into the court of the United Nations. Now, as I read the record, the UN was not attempting to arbitrate or adjudicate rights and wrongs. It was confronting a very practical problem. There were two national communities in Palestine and there were irreconcilable differences on fundamental questions, most importantly, looking at the historic record on the question of immigration, and associate with the question of immigration, the question of land.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The UN Special Committee on Palestine, which came into being before the UN 181 Partition Resolution. The UN Special Committee recommended two states in Palestine. There was a minority position represented by Iran, India, Yugoslavia. They supported one state. But they believed that if forced to, the two communities would figure out some sort of modus vivendi and live together. United Nations General Assembly supported partition between what it called a Jewish state and an Arab state. Now, in my reading of the record, and I understand there&#8217;s new scholarship in the subject which I&#8217;ve not read, but so far as I&#8217;ve read the record, there&#8217;s no clarity on what the United Nations General Assembly meant by a Jewish state and an Arab state, except for the fact that the Jewish state would be, demographically, the majority would be Jewish, and the Arab state demographically would be Arab.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The UNSCOP, the UN Special Committee on Palestine, it was very clear and it was reiterated many times that in recommending two states, each state, the Arab state and the Jewish state, would have to guarantee full equality of all citizens with regard to political, civil, and religious matters. Now, that does raise the question if there is absolute full equality of all citizens, both in the Jewish state and the Arab state with regard to political rights, civil rights, and religious rights. Apart from the demographic majority, it&#8217;s very unclear what it meant to call a state Jewish or call a state Arab.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">In my view, the Partition Resolution was the correct decision. I do not believe that the Arab and Jewish communities could, at that point, be made to live together. I disagree with the minority position of India, Iran, and Yugoslavia. And that not being a practical option, two states was the only other option. In this regard, I would want to pay tribute to what was probably the most moving speech at the UN General Assembly proceedings by the Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko. I was very tempted to quote it at length, but I recognized that would be taking too much time. So I asked a young friend, Jamie Stern-Weiner to edit it and just get the essence of what Foreign Minister Gromyko had to say.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8221; During the last war,&#8221; Gromyko said, &#8220;The Jewish people underwent exceptional sorrow and suffering. Without any exaggeration, this sorrow and suffering are indescribable. Hundreds of thousands of Jews are wandering about in various countries of Europe in search of means of existence and in search of shelter. The United Nations cannot and must not regard this situation with indifference. Past experience, particularly during the Second World War, shows that no Western European state was able to provide adequate assistance for the Jewish people in defending its rights and its very existence from the violence of the Hitlerites and their allies. This is an unpleasant fact. But unfortunately, like all other facts, it must be admitted.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Gromyko went on to say, in principle, he supports one state, or the Soviet Union supports one state. But he said, &#8221; If relations between the Jewish and Arab populations of Palestine proved to be so bad that would be impossible to reconcile them and to ensure the peaceful coexistence of the Arabs and the Jews, the Soviet Union would support two states. I personally am not convinced that the two states would have been unsustainable in the long term if, and this is big if, the Zionist movement had been faithful to the position that proclaimed during the UNSCOP public hearings.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">At the time Ben-Gurion testified, &#8220;I want to express what we mean by a Jewish state. We mean by a Jewish state, simply a state where the majority of the people are Jews, not a state where a Jew has in any way any privilege more than anyone else. A Jewish state means a state based on absolute equality of all her citizens and on democracy. Alas, this was not to be.&#8221; As Professor Morris has written, &#8220;Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily an elementally expansionist.&#8221; And then he wrote in another book, &#8220;Transfer&#8230;&#8221; The euphemism for expulsion, &#8220;Transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism because it sought to transform a land which was Arab into a Jewish state. And a Jewish state could not have arisen without a major displacement of Arab population. And because this aim automatically produced resistance among the Arabs, which in turn persuade the Yishuv&#8217;s leaders,&#8221; the Yishuv being the Jewish community, &#8220;The Yishuv&#8217;s leaders, that a hostile Arab majority or a large minority could not remain in place if a Jewish state was to arise or safely endure.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Or as Professor Morris retrospectively put it, &#8220;A removing of a population was needed. Without a population expulsion, a Jewish state would not have been established.&#8221; The Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution. I won&#8217;t play games with that. I know a lot of people try to prove it&#8217;s not true. It clearly, in my view, is true. The Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution. While Israeli leaders acting on the compulsions inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism, found the pretext in the course of the first Arab-Israeli war to expel the indigenous population and expand its borders. I therefore conclude that neither side was committed to the letter of the partition resolution and both sides aborted it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. UNSCOP, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine recommended partition. The majority of UNSCOP recommended partition, which was accepted by the UN General Assembly in November, 1947. Essentially, looking back to the Peel Commission in 1937, 10 years earlier, a British Commission had looked at the problem of Palestine, the two warring national groups who refused to live together, if you like, or consolidate a unitary state between them. And Peel said there should be two states. That&#8217;s the principle. The country must be partitioned in two states. This would give a modicum of justice to both sides, if not all their demands, of course.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the United Nations followed suit. The United Nations, UNSCOP and then the UN General Assembly representing the will of the international community said two states is the just solution in this complex situation. The problem was that immediately with the passage of the resolution, the Arabs, Arab states and the Arabs of Palestine said no. As Norman Finkelstein said, they said no. They rejected the partition idea, the principle of partition, not just the idea of what percentage which side should get, but the principle of partition they said no to, the Jews should not have any part of Palestine for their sovereign territory. Maybe Jews could live as a minority in Palestine. That also was problematic in the eyes of the Palestinian Arab leadership.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Husayni had said, only Jews who were there before 1917 could actually get citizenship and continue to live there. But the Arabs rejected partition and the Arabs of Palestine launched, in very disorganized fashion, war against the resolution, against the implementation of the resolution, against the Jewish community in Palestine. And this was their defeat in that civil war between the two communities, while the British were withdrawing from Palestine, led to the Arab invasion, the invasion by the Arab states in May, 1948 of the country. Again, basically with the idea of eradicating or preventing the emergence of a Jewish state in line with the United Nations decision and the will of the international community.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Norman said that the Zionist enterprise, and he quoted me, meant from the beginning to transfer or expel the Arabs of Palestine or some of the Arabs of Palestine. And I think he&#8217;s quoting out of context. The context in which the statements were made that the Jewish state could only emerge if there was a transfer of Arab population was proceeded in the way I wrote it, and the way it actually happened by Arab resistance and hostilities towards the Jewish community. Had the Arabs accepted partition, there would&#8217;ve been a large Arab minority in the Jewish state which emerged in &#8217;47. And in fact, Jewish economists and state builders took into account that there would be a large Arab minority and its needs would be cared for, et cetera.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But this was not to be because the Arabs attacked. And had they not attacked, perhaps a Jewish state with a large Arab minority could have emerged. But this didn&#8217;t happen. They went to war. The Jews resisted. And in the course of that war, Arab populations were driven out. Some were expelled, some left because Arab leaders advised them to leave or ordered them to leave. And at the end of the war, Israel said they can&#8217;t return because they just tried to destroy the Jewish state. And that&#8217;s the basic reality of what happened in &#8217;48. The Jews created a state. The Palestinian Arabs never bothered to even try to create a state before &#8217;48 and in the course of the 1948 war. And for that reason, they have no state to this day. The Jews do have a state because they prepared to establish a state, fought for it, and established it, hopefully lastingly.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Let me just add to clarify. The war had two parts to it. The first part was the Arab community in Palestine, its militiamen attacked the Jews from November, 1947. In other words, from the day after the UN Partition Resolution was passed, Arab gunmen were busy shooting up Jews, and that snowballed into a full scale civil war between the two communities in Palestine. In May, 1948, a second stage began in the war in which the Arab states invaded, the new state attacked the new state, and they too were defeated. And thus the state of Israel emerged. In the course of this two stage war, a vast Palestinian refugee problem occurred.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so after that, the transfer, the expulsion, the thing that people call the Nakba happened. Mouin, could you speak to 1948 and the historical significance of it?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Sure. There&#8217;s a lot to unpack here. I&#8217;ll try to limit myself to just a few points regarding Zionism and transfer. I think Chaim Weizmann, the head of the world&#8217;s Zionist organization, had it exactly right when he said that the objective of Zionism is to make Palestine as Jewish as England is English or France is French. In other words, as Norman explained, a Jewish state requires Jewish political demographic and territorial supremacy. Without those three elements, the state would be Jewish in name only. And I think what distinguishes Zionism is its insistence, supremacy and exclusivity. That would be my first point.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">The second point is, I think what the Soviet foreign minister at the time Andrei Gromyko said is exactly right, with one reservation. Gromyko was describing a European savagery unleashed against Europe&#8217;s Jews. At the time, it wasn&#8217;t Palestinians or Arabs. The savages and the barbarians were European to the core. It had nothing to do with developments in Palestine or the Middle East. Secondly, at the time that Gromyko was speaking, those Jewish survivors of the Holocaust and others who were in need of safe haven were still overwhelmingly on the European continent and not in Palestine.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And I think, given the scale of the savagery, I don&#8217;t think that any one state or country should have borne the responsibility for addressing this crisis. I think it should have been an international responsibility. The Soviet Union could have contributed, Germany certainly could and should have contributed, the United Kingdom and the United States which slammed their doors shut to the persecuted Jews of Europe as the Nazis were rising to power, they certainly should have played a role. But instead, what passed for the international community at the time, decided to partition Palestine. And here I think we need to judge the Partition Resolution against the realities that obtained at the time time.</span>

        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Two thirds of the population of Palestine was Arab. The Yishuv, the Jewish community in Palestine, constituted about one third of the total population and controlled even less of the land within Palestine. As a preeminent Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi has pointed out, the Partition Resolution in giving roughly 55% of Palestine to the Jewish community, and I think 41, 42% to the Arab community, to the Palestinians, did not preserve the position of each community, or even favor one community at the expense of the other. Rather, it thoroughly inverted and revolutionized the relationship between the two communities.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">And as many have written, the Nakba was the inevitable consequence of partition given the nature of Zionism, given the territorial disposition, given the weakness of the Palestinian community whose leadership had been largely decimated during a major revolt at the end of the 1930s, given that the Arab states were still very much under French and British influence, the Nakba was inevitable, the inevitable product of the Partition Resolution. And one last point also about the UN&#8217;s Partition Resolution is, yes, formally, that is what the international community decided on the 29th of November, 1947. It&#8217;s not a resolution that could ever have gotten through the UN General Assembly today for a very simple reason. It was a very different general assembly.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">

            <span class="ts-text">Most African, most Asian states were not yet independent. Were the resolution to be placed before the international community today, and I find it telling that the minority opinion was led by India, Iran, and Yugoslavia, I think they would&#8217;ve represented the clear majority. So partition, given what we know about Zionism, given that it was entirely predictable what would happen, given the realities on the ground in Palestine was deeply unjust, and the idea that either the Palestinians or the Arab states could have accepted such a resolution is, I think, an illusion. That was in 1947. We saw what happened in &#8217;48 and &#8217;49. Palestinian society was essentially destroyed. Over 80%, I believe, of Palestinians residents in the territory that became the state of Israel were either expelled or fled and ultimately were ethnically cleansed because ethnic cleansing consists of two components. It&#8217;s not just forcing people into refuge or expelling them, it&#8217;s just as importantly preventing their return. And Benny Morris has written, I think, a article about Yosef Weitz and the transfer committees. There was a very detailed initiative to prevent the return and it consisted of raising hundreds of Palestinian villages to the ground, which was systematically implemented and so on. And so Palestinians became a stateless people.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Now, what is the most important reason that no Arab state was established in Palestine? Well, since the 1930s, the Zionist leadership and the Hashemite leadership of Jordan, as it&#8217;s been thoroughly researched and written about by the Israeli-British historian Avi Shlaim, essentially colluded to prevent the establishment of an independent Arab state in Palestine in the late 1940s. There&#8217;s much more here, but I think those are the key points I would make about 1948.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I think it&#8217;s interesting where people choose to start the history. I noticed a lot of people like to start at either &#8217;47 or &#8217;48 because it&#8217;s the first time where they can clearly point to a catastrophe that occurs on the Arab side, that they want to ascribe 100% of the blame to the newly emergent Israeli state to. But I feel like when you have this type of reading of history, it feels like the goal is to moralize everything first and then to pick and choose facts that support the statements of your initial moral statement afterwards. Whenever people are talking about &#8217;48 or the establishment of the Arab state, I never hear about the fact that a civil war started in &#8217;47. That was largely instigated because of the Arab rejectionism of the &#8217;47 partition plan.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I never hear about the fact that the majority of the land that was acquired happened by purchases from Jewish organizations of Palestinian Arabs of the Ottoman Empire before the mandatory period in 1920 even started. Funnily enough, king Abdullah of Jordan was quoted as saying, &#8220;The Arabs are as prodigal in selling their land as they are in weeping about it.&#8221; I never hear about the multiple times that Arabs rejected partition, rejected living with Jews, rejected any sort of state that would&#8217;ve even had any sort of Jewish exclusivity. It&#8217;s funny because it was brought up before that the partition plan was unfair, and that&#8217;s why the Arabs rejected it, as though they rejected it because it was unfair, because of the amount of land that Jews were given and not just due to the fact that Jews were given land at all, as though a 30% partition or a 25% partition would&#8217;ve been accepted when I don&#8217;t think that was the reality of the circumstances.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I feel like most of the other stuff has been said, but I noticed that whenever people talk about &#8217;48 or the years preceding &#8217;48, I think the worst thing that happens is there&#8217;s a cherry-picking of the facts where basically all of the blame is ascribed to this built-in idea of Zionism because of a handful of quotes or because of an ideology, we can say that transfer or population expulsion or basically the mandate of all of these Arabs being kicked off the land was always going to happen, when I think there&#8217;s a refusal sometimes as well to acknowledge that regardless of the ideas of some of the Zionist leaders, there is a political, social and military reality on the ground that they&#8217;re forced to contend with.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And unfortunately, the Arabs, because of their inability to engage in diplomacy and only to use tools of war to try to negotiate everything going on in mandatory Palestine, basically always gave the Jews a reason or an excuse to fight and acquire land through that way because of their refusal to negotiate on anything else, whether it was the partition plan in &#8217;47, whether it was the Lausanne peace conference afterwards where Israel even offered to annex Gaza in &#8217;51, where they offered to take in a hundred thousand refugees. Every single deal is just rejected out of hand because the Arabs don&#8217;t want a Jewish state anywhere in this region of the world.</span>

And the problem is, it&#8217;s a kind of quicksilver. It&#8217;s very hard to grasp a point and hold you to it. So we&#8217;re going to try here to see whether we can hold you to a point.

            <span class="ts-text">Mainstream Israeli historian to say, as you did in that first book, that from the very beginning, transfer figured prominently in Zionist thinking that was an unusual, if you read Anita Shapira, you read Shabtai Teveth that was an unusual acknowledgement by you. And then I found it very impressive that in that revised version of your first book, you devoted 25 pages to copiously documenting the salience of transfer in Zionist thinking. And in fact, you used a very provocative and resonant phrase.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You said that transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism. We&#8217;re not talking about circumstantial factors, a war, Arab hostility. You said it&#8217;s inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism. Now, as I said, so we won&#8217;t be accused of cherry picking. Those were 25 very densely argued pages. And then in an interview, and I could cite several quotes, but I&#8217;ll choose one, you said, &#8220;Removing a population was needed.&#8221; Let&#8217;s look at the words. &#8220;Without a population expulsion, a Jewish state would not have been established.&#8221; Now you are the one&#8230; Again, I was very surprised when I read your book here. I&#8217;m referring to &#8220;Righteous Victims.&#8221; I was very surprised when I came to that page 37, where you wrote that territorial displacement and dispossession was the chief motor of Arab resistance to Zionism. Territorial displacement and dispossession were the chief motor of Arab resistance to Zionism.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So you then went on to say, because the Arab population rationally feared territorial displacement and dispossession, it of course opposed Zionism. That&#8217;s as normal as Native Americans opposing the Euro-American manifest destiny in the history of our own country because they understood it would be at their expense. It was inbuilt and inevitable.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And so now for you to come along and say that it all happened just because of the war, that otherwise the Zionists made all these plans for a happy minority to live there, that simply does not gel. It does not cohere. It is not reconcilable with what you yourself have written. It was inevitable and inbuilt.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Now, in other situations, you&#8217;ve said that&#8217;s true with, I think it was a greater good to establish a Jewish state at the expense of the indigenous population.

He said, we don&#8217;t want the whole of North America to remain a squalid refuge for these wigwams and teepees. We have to get rid of them and make this a great country.

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; and predictable. No, no, no, I&#8217;ve never said that. It was inevitable and predictable only because the Arabs assaulted the Jewish community and state in 1947/48. Had there been no assault, there probably wouldn&#8217;t have been a refugee problem. There&#8217;s no reason for a refugee problem to have occurred, expulsions to have occurred, a massive dispossession to occur. These occurred as a result of war.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Now, Norman has said that, I said that transfer was inbuilt into Zionism in one way or another. And this is certainly true in order to buy land, the Jews bought tracts of land on which some Arabs sometimes lived. Sometimes they bought tracts of land on which there weren&#8217;t Arab villages, but sometimes they bought land on which there were Arabs.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And according to Ottoman law, and the British, at least in the initial years of the British mandate, the law said that the people who bought the land could do what they liked with the people who didn&#8217;t own the land, who were basically squatting on the land, which is the Arab tenant farmers, which is we&#8217;re talking about a very small number actually of Arabs who were displaced as a result of land purchases in the Ottoman period or the mandate period.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But there was dispossession in one way. They didn&#8217;t possess the land. They didn&#8217;t own it, but they were removed from the land. And this did happen in Zionism. And there&#8217;s, if you like, an inevitability in Zionist ideology of buying tracts of land and starting to work it yourself and settle it with your own people and so on. That made sense.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But what we&#8217;re really talking about is what happened in 47/48. And in 47/48, the Arabs started a war. And actually people pay for their mistakes. And the Palestinians have never actually agreed to pay for their mistakes. They make mistakes, they attack, they suffer as a result.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And we see something similar going on today in the Gaza Strip. They do something terrible. They kill 1,200 Jews. They abduct 250 women and children and babies and old people and whatever. And then they start screaming, please save us from what we did because the Jews are counterattacking. And this is what happened then. And this is what&#8217;s happening now. There&#8217;s something fairly similar in the situation here.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Expulsion, and this is important, Norman, you should pay attention to this. You didn&#8217;t raise that. Expulsion transfer whenever policy of the Zionist movement before 47, it doesn&#8217;t exist in Zionist platforms of the various political parties, of the Zionist organization, of the Israeli state, of the Jewish agency. Nobody would&#8217;ve actually made it into policy because it was always a large minority. If there were people who wanted it, always a large minority of Jewish politicians and leaders would&#8217;ve said, no, this is immoral. We cannot start a state on the basis of an expulsion.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So it was never adopted and actually was never adopted as policy even in 48, even though Ben-Gurion wanted as few Arabs in the course of the war staying in the Jewish state after they attacked it. He didn&#8217;t want disloyal citizens staying there because they wouldn&#8217;t have been loyal citizens. But this made sense in the war itself. But the movement itself and its political parties never accepted it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It&#8217;s true that in 1937, when the British, as part of the proposal by the Peel Commission to divide the country into two states, one Arab, one Jewish, which the Arabs of course rejected, Peel also recommended most of the Arabs in the Jewish state should be transferred because otherwise, if they stayed and were disloyal to the emergent Jewish state, this would cause endless disturbances, warfare, killing, and so on.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So Ben-Gurion and Weizmann latched onto this proposal by the most famous democracy in the world, the British democracy, when they proposed the idea of transfer side by side with the idea of partition because it made sense. And they said, well, if the British say so, we should also advocate it. But they never actually tried to pass it as Zionist policy, and they fairly quickly stopped even talking about transfer after 1938.</span>

Well, I think there&#8217;s two problems with that. I think what you&#8217;re saying about localized disputes is correct, but I also think that there is a whole literature that demonstrates that transfer was envisioned by Zionist leaders on a much broader skill than simply individual land purchases. In other words, it went way beyond, we need to remove these tenants so that we can farm this land. The idea was we can&#8217;t have a state where all these Arabs remain and we have to get rid of them.</span>

And that transfer forced displacement was fundamental to that project. And just responding to&#8230;. Sorry, was it-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. You made the point that the problem here is that people don&#8217;t recognize is that the first and last result for the Arabs is always war. I think there&#8217;s a problem with that. I think you might do well to recall the 1936 general strike conducted by Palestinians at the beginning of the revolt, which at the time was the longest recorded general strike in history.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">If we look at today, the Palestinians are once again going to the International Court of Justice. They&#8217;re consistently trying to persuade the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to do his job. They have launched widespread boycott campaigns. So of course the Palestinians have engaged in military resistance. But I think the suggestion that this has always been their first and last resort and that they have somehow spurned civic action, spurned diplomacy, I think really has no basis in reality.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I&#8217;ll respond to that. And then a question for Norm to take into account. I think when he answers Benny, because I am curious, obviously I have fresher eyes on this and I&#8217;m a newcomer to this arena versus the three of you guys for sure. A claim that gets brought up a lot has to do with the inevitability of transfer and Zionism or the idea that as soon as the Jews envisioned a state in Palestine, they knew that it would involve some mass transfer population, perhaps a mass expulsion. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll talk about Plan Dalet or Plan D at some point.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The issue that I run into is while you can find quotes from leaders, while you can find maybe desires expressed in diaries, I feel like it&#8217;s hard to truly ever know if there would&#8217;ve been mass transfer in the face of Arab peace, because I feel like every time there was a huge deal on the table that would&#8217;ve had a sizable Jewish and Arab population living together, the Arabs would reject it out of hand.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So for instance, when we say that transfer was inevitable, when we say that Zionists would&#8217;ve never accepted a sizable Arab population, how do you explain the acceptance of the 47 partition plan that would&#8217;ve had a huge Arab population living in the Jewish state? Is your contention that after the acceptance of that, after the establishment of that state, that Jews would&#8217;ve slowly started to expel all of these Arab citizens from their country?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; 200,000 so people, those citizens, but I&#8217;m just curious, how do we get this idea of Zionism always means mass transfer when there were times, at least early on in the history of Israel and a little bit before it, where Israel would&#8217;ve accepted a state that would&#8217;ve had a massive Arab population in it.

Number one, it was the old historians who would point to the fact and Professor Morris&#8217;s terminology, the old historians, what he called not real historians, he called them chroniclers, not real historians. It was the old Israeli historians who denied the centrality of transfer in Zionist thinking. It was then Professor Morris who contrary to Israel&#8217;s historian establishment, who said, now you remind me it&#8217;s four pages, but it came at the end of the book. It was-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">We&#8217;re also asked, well, this is true. Why did that happen? Why did that happen? It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a very simple fact which everybody understands.

            <span class="ts-text">It was the British mandate. There was significant Arab resistance to Zionism, and that resistance was based on the fact, as you said, the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.

            <span class="ts-text">Let me respond. Look, you&#8217;ve said it a number of times that the Arabs from fairly early on in the conflict from the 1890s or the early 1900s said the Jews intend to expel us. This doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s true. It means that some Arabs said this, maybe believing it was true, maybe using it as a political instrument to gain support to mobilize Arabs against the Zionist experiment.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But the fact is transfer did not occur before 1947, and Arabs later said, and since then have said that the Jews want to build a third temple on the Temple Mount as if that&#8217;s what really the mainstream of Zionism has always wanted and always strived for. But this is nonsense. It&#8217;s something that Husseini used to use as a way to mobilize masses for the cause, using religion as the way to get them to join him. The fact that Arabs said that the Zionists want to dispossess us doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s true. It just means that there&#8217;s some Arabs thought that maybe said it sincerely and maybe insincerely.</span>

We don&#8217;t need to go to the quotes. We can legitimately ask, how central is expulsion to Zionism in its early version of Zionism and whatever Zionism is today, and how much power influence does Zionism and ideology have in Israel and the influence, the philosophy, the ideology of Zionism have on Israel today?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The Zionist movement up to 1948, Zionist ideology was central to the whole Zionist experience, the whole enterprise up to 1948. And I think Zionist ideology was also important in the first decades of Israel&#8217;s existence. Slowly, the hold of Zionism, if you like, like Bolshevism held the Soviet Union gradually faded, and a lot of Israelis today think in terms of individual success and then the capitalism and all sorts of things, which had nothing to do with Zionism, but Zionism was very important.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But what I&#8217;m saying is that the idea of transfer wasn&#8217;t the core of Zionism. The idea of Zionism was to save the Jews who had been vastly persecuted in Eastern Europe, and incidentally in the Arab world, the Muslim world for centuries, and eventually ending up with the Holocaust. The idea of Zionism was to save the Jewish people by establishing a state or re-establishing a Jewish state on the ancient Jewish homeland, which is something that Arabs today even deny that there were Jews in Palestine or the land of Israel 2000 years ago.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Arafat famously said, &#8220;What Temple was there on Temple Mount? Maybe it was in Nablus.&#8221; Which of course is nonsense. But they had a strong connection for thousands of years to the land to which they wanted to return and return there. They found that on the land lived hundreds of thousands of Arabs, and the question was how to accommodate the vision of a Jewish state in Palestine alongside the existence of these Arab masses living on who were indigenous, in fact, to the land by that stage.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the idea of partition because they couldn&#8217;t live together because the Arabs didn&#8217;t want to live together with the Jews. And I think the Jews also didn&#8217;t want to live together in one state with Arabs in general. The idea of partition was the thing which the Zionists accepted, okay, we can only get a small part of Palestine. The Arabs will get in 37. Most of Palestine in 1947 the ratios were changed, but we can live side by side with each other in a partitioned Palestine. And this was the essence of it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The idea of transfer was there, but it was never adopted as policy. But in 1947/48, the Arabs attacked trying to destroy essentially the Zionist enterprise and the emerging Jewish state. And the reaction was transfer in some way, not as policy, but this is what happened on the battlefield. And this is also what Ben-Gurion at some point began to want as well.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">One of the first books on this issue I read when I was still in high school because my late father had it, was &#8220;The Diaries of Theodor Herzl.&#8221; And I think Theodor Herzl, of course, was the founder of the contemporary Zionist movement. And I think if you read that, it&#8217;s very clear for Herzl the model upon which the Zionist movement would proceed. His model was Cecil Rhodes.</span>

And Herzl also says explicitly in his diaries, that it is essential to remove the existing population from Palestine.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; Yeah, five volumes. There&#8217;s one paragraph which actually mentions the idea of transfer. There are people who think that Herzl was actually pointing to South America when he was talking about that the Jews were going to move to Argentina, and then they would try and buy out or buy off or spirit the penniless natives to make way for Jewish settlement. Maybe he wasn&#8217;t even talking about the Arabs in that particular passage. That&#8217;s the argument of some people. Maybe he was.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But the point is it has only a 1% of the diary, which is devoted to this subject. It&#8217;s not a central idea in Herzl&#8217;s thinking. What Herzl wanted, and this is what&#8217;s important, not Rhodes, I don&#8217;t think he was the model. Herzl wanted to create a liberal democratic western state in Palestine for the Jews. That was the idea. Not some imperial enterprise serving some imperial master, which is what Rhodes was about.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But to have a Jewish state, which was modeled on the western democracies in Palestine, and this incidentally was more or less what Weizmann and Ben-Gurion wanted. Ben-Gurion was more of a socialist. Weizmann was more of a liberal westerner, but they wanted to establish a social democratic or liberal state in Palestine.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And they both envisioned through most of the years of their activity that there would be an Arab minority in that Jewish state. It&#8217;s true that Ben-Gurion strived to have as small as possible an Arab minority in the Jewish state because he knew that if you want a Jewish majority state, that would be necessary, but it&#8217;s not something which they were willing to translate into actual policy.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Just a quick pause to mention that for people who are not familiar, Theodor Herzl we&#8217;re talking about over a century ago, and everything we&#8217;ve been talking about has been mostly 1948 and before.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yes. Just one clarification on Herzl&#8217;s diaries. I mean, the other thing that I recall from those diaries is he was very preoccupied with, in fact, getting great power patronage, seeing Palestine, the Jewish state in Palestine, I think his words, an outpost of civilization against barbarism. In other words, very much seeing his project as a proxy for Western imperialism-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; who he tried to cultivate. I just want to respond to a point you made earlier, which was that people expressed the rejection of the partition resolution on the grounds that it gave the majority of Palestine to the Jewish community, which formed only a third. Whereas in fact, if I understood you correctly, you&#8217;re saying the Palestinians and the Arabs would have rejected any partition resolution.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, a couple of things that one, they would&#8217;ve rejected any. Two, a lot of that land given was in the Negev. It was pretty terrible land at the time. And then three, the land that would&#8217;ve been partitioned to Jews I think would&#8217;ve been, I think I saw it was like 500,000&#8230; It would&#8217;ve been 500,000 Jews, 400,000 Arabs, and I think like 80,000 Bedouins would&#8217;ve been there. So the state would&#8217;ve been divided pretty close to them.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think you raise a valid point because I think the Palestinians did reject the partition of their homeland in principle. And I think the fact that the United Nations General Assembly then awarded the majority of their homeland to the Zionist movement only added in salt to injury. I mean, one doesn&#8217;t have to sympathize with the Palestinians to recognize that they have now been a stateless people for 75 years.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Can you name any country yours, for example, or yours, that would be prepared to give 55%, 25%, 10% of your country to the Palestinians? Of course not. And so the issue was not the existence of Jews in Palestine. They had been there for centuries, and of course they had ties to Palestine and particularly to Jerusalem and other places going back centuries if not millennia.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But the idea of establishing an exclusively Jewish state at the expense of those who were already living there, I think it was right to reject that. And I don&#8217;t think we can look back now 75 years later and say, well, you should have accepted losing 55% of your homeland because you ended up losing 78% of it, and the remaining 22% was occupied in 1967. That&#8217;s not how things work.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And I can imagine an American rejecting giving 10% of the United States to the Palestinians, and if that rejection leads to war and you lose half your country, I doubt that 50 years from now you&#8217;re going to say, well, maybe I should have accepted that.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Sure. So I like this answer more than what I usually feel like I&#8217;m hearing when it comes to the Palestinian rejection of the 47 partition plan. Sometimes I feel like a weird switch happens to where the Arabs in the area are actually presented as entirely pragmatic people who are simply doing a calculation and saying like, well, we&#8217;re losing 55% of our land. Jews are only maybe one third of the people here, and we&#8217;ve got 45. And no, the math doesn&#8217;t work, basically. But it wasn&#8217;t a math problem. I think, like you said-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Now, I do believe there&#8217;s a legitimate question, had it been the case, as you said, Professor Morris, that the Zionists wanted to create a happy state with a Jewish majority, but a large Jewish minority, and if by virtue of immigration, like in our own country &#8230; in our own country, given the current trajectories, non-whites will become the majority population in the United States quite soon. And according to democratic principles, we have to accept that. So if that were the case, I would say maybe there&#8217;s an argument that had there been mass Jewish immigration that changed the demographic balance in Palestine and therefore Jews became the majority, you can make an argument in the abstract that the indigenous Arab population should have been accepting of that, just as &#8216;whites&#8217; in the United States have to be accepting of the fact that the demographic majority is shifting to non-whites in our own country.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But that&#8217;s not what Zionism was about. I did write my doctoral dissertation on Zionism, and I don&#8217;t want to get now bogged down in abstract ideas, but as I suspect you know, most theorists of nationalism say there are two kinds of nationalism. One is a nationalism based on citizenship. You become a citizen, you&#8217;re integral to the country. That&#8217;s sometimes called political nationalism. And then there&#8217;s another kind of nationalism, and that says the state should not belong to its citizens, it should belong to an ethnic group. Each ethnic group should have its own state. It&#8217;s usually called the German romantic idea of nationalism.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Zionism is squarely in the German romantic idea.

I doubt Khrushchev could have spelled Bolshevik. But for the period we&#8217;re talking about, they were Zionists, they were committed to their exclusive state with a minority living on sufferance, or at worst expelled. That was their ideology. And I really feel there&#8217;s a problem with your happy vision of these Western Democrats like Weitzman, and they wanted to live peacefully with their Arabs. Weitzman described the expulsion in 1948 as &#8216;the miraculous clearing of the land.&#8217; That doesn&#8217;t sound like somebody shedding too many tears at the loss of the indigenous population.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">No, no, no, no. Wait a minute. It&#8217;s not fantasy. At the beginning, they received citizenship, could vote in elections for their own people, and they were put into parliament. But in the first years, the Jewish majority suspected that maybe the Arabs would be disloyal, because they had just tried to destroy the Jewish state. Then they dropped the military government and they became fully equal citizens. So if the whole idea was they must have a state without Arabs, this didn&#8217;t happen in &#8217;49, and it didn&#8217;t happen in the subsequent decades.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Because you are missing the first section of that paragraph, which was they were being assaulted by the Arabs, and as a result, a Jewish state could not have come into being unless there had also been an expulsion of the population which was trying to kill them.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think just one last point on this. I remember reading your book when it first came out, and reading one incident after the other, and one example after the other, and then getting to the conclusion where you said the Nakba was a product of war, not design, I think were your exact words. And I remember reacting almost in shock to that, that I felt you had mobilized overwhelming evidence that it was a product of design, not war. And I think our discussion today very much reflects, let&#8217;s say, the dissonance between the evidence and the conclusion. You don&#8217;t feel that the research that you have conducted and published demonstrates that it was in fact inherent and inbuilt and inevitable. And I think the point that Norm and I are making is that your own historical research, together with that of others, indisputably demonstrates that it does. I think that&#8217;s a fundamental disagreement we&#8217;re having here.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, yeah, can I actually respond to that? Because I think this is emblematic of the entire conversation. I watched a lot of Norm&#8217;s interviews and conversations in preparation for this, and I hear Norm will say this over and over and over again. &#8220;I only deal in facts. I don&#8217;t deal in hypotheticals. I only deal in facts. I only deal in facts.&#8221; And that seems to be the case, except for when the facts are completely and totally contrary to the particular point you&#8217;re trying to push. The idea that Jews would&#8217;ve out of hand rejected any state that had Arabs on it or always had a plan of expulsion is just betrayed by the acceptance of the &#8217;47 partition plan.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. She is the only one who tried to persuasively argue that the Zionist movement was actually, not formally, actually committed to the binational idea. But most historians of the subject agree, the Zionist movement was committed to the idea of a Jewish state. Having written my doctoral dissertation on the topic, I was confirmed in that idea, because Professor Chomsky, who was my closest friend for about 40 years, was very committed to the idea that bi-nationalism was the dominant trend in Zionism. I couldn&#8217;t go with him there.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But Professor Morris, you are aware that until the Biltmore resolution in 1942, the Zionist movement never declared it was for a Jewish state. Why? Because it was politically impossible at the moment, until 1942. There&#8217;s your ideology, there are your convictions, there are your operative plans, and there&#8217;s also, separately, what you say in public. The Zionist movement couldn&#8217;t say in public, &#8220;We&#8217;re expelling all the Arabs.&#8221; They can&#8217;t say that. And they couldn&#8217;t even say, &#8220;We support a Jewish state,&#8221; until 1942.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You can say that, but in this case, the facts betray you. There was no Arab acceptance of anything that would&#8217;ve allowed for a Jewish state to exist, number one, and number two, I think that it&#8217;s entirely possible, given how things happen after a war, that this exact same conflict could have played out and an expulsion would&#8217;ve happened without any ideology at play. There was a people that disagreed on who had territorial rights to a land, there was a massive war afterwards, and then a bunch of their friends invaded after to reinforce the idea that the Jewish people in this case couldn&#8217;t have a state. There could have been a transfer regardless.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I wouldn&#8217;t say there were always pogroms in every Arab state. I think there was flight of Arab Jews for multiple reasons, in some cases for precisely the reasons you say. If you look at the Jewish community in Algeria, for example, their flight had virtually nothing to do with the Arab-Israeli conflict. The issue of Algerian Jews was that the French gave them citizenship during their colonial rule of Algeria, and they increasingly became identified with French rule, when Algeria became independent and all the French ended up leaving, out of fear, or out of disappointment, or out of whatever, the Jews were identified as French rather than Algerian.</span>

Now, I don&#8217;t know how you guys feel about the Nakba, but when the analysis of the Nakba comes in, again, it&#8217;s back to that; well, that was actually just a top-down expulsion. The retreat of wealthy Arab people in the &#8217;30s didn&#8217;t matter. Any of the messaging from the surrounding Arab states didn&#8217;t matter. It was just an expulsion from Jewish people or people running from their lives from Jewish massacres. Again, I feel like it&#8217;s a selective critical analysis of the-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Okay, I need to just comment on that. I was rereading Shlomo Ben-Ami&#8217;s last book, and he does at the end discuss at some length the whole issue of the refugee question bearing on the so-called peace process. And on the question of &#8217;48 and the Arab immigration, if you&#8217;ll allow me, let me just quote him. &#8220;Israel is particularly fond of the awkwardly false symmetry she makes between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced immigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries following the creation of the state of Israel, as if it were &#8216;an unplanned exchange of populations.&#8217;.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And then Mr Ben-Ami, for those of you who are listening, he was Israel&#8217;s former foreign minister, and he&#8217;s an influential historian in his own right, he says, &#8220;In fact, envoys from the Mossad and the Jewish Agency worked underground in Arab countries and Iran to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More importantly, for many Jews in Arab states, the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the combination of millennial aspirations. It represented the consummation of a dream to take part in Israel&#8217;s resurgence as a nation.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So this idea that they were all expelled after 1948, that&#8217;s one area, Professor Morris, I defer to expertise. That&#8217;s one of my credos in life. I don&#8217;t know the Israeli literature. But as it&#8217;s been translated in English, there&#8217;s very little solid scholarship on what happened in 1948 in the Arab countries which caused the Jews to leave.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">No, no, Steven is right. There was a pull and a push mechanism in the departure of the Jews from the Arab lands post &#8217;48. But there was also a lot of push. A lot of push.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And on the point of agreement, on this one brief light of agreement, let us wrap up with this topic of history and move on to modern day. But before that, I&#8217;m wondering if we could just say a couple of last words on this topic. Steven?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah. I think that when you look at the behaviors of both parties in the time period around &#8217;48, or especially &#8217;48 and earlier, there&#8217;s this assumption that there was this huge built-in mechanism of Zionism, and that it was going to be inevitable from the inception of the first Zionist thought that appeared in Herzl&#8217;s mind that there would be a mass violent population transfer of Arab Palestinians out of what would become the Israeli state. I understand that there are some quotes that we can find that maybe seem to possibly support an idea that looks close to that, but I think when you actually consult the record of what happened, when you look at the massive populations that Israel was willing to accept within what would become their state borders, their nation borders, I just don&#8217;t think that the historical record agrees with the idea that Zionists would&#8217;ve just never been okay living alongside Arab Palestinians.</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name"></span>

            <span class="ts-text">But when you look at the other side, Arabs would out of hand reject literally any deal that apportioned any amount of that land for any state relating to Jewish people or the Israeli people. I think it was said, even on the other end of the table, that Arab Palestinians or Arabs would&#8217;ve never accepted any Jewish state whatsoever.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So it&#8217;s interesting that on the ideology part where it&#8217;s claimed that Zionists are people of exclusion and supremacy and expulsion, we can find that in diary entries, but we can find that expressed in very real terms on the Arab side, I think in all of their behavior around &#8217;48 and earlier, where the goal was the destruction of the Israeli state, it would&#8217;ve been the dispossession of many Jewish people. It probably would&#8217;ve been the expulsion of a lot of them back to Europe. And I think that very clearly plays out in the difference between the actions of the Arabs versus some diary entries of some Jewish leaders.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, one thing which stood out, and I think Mouin made this point, is that the Arabs had nothing to do with the Holocaust, but then the world community forced the Arabs to pay the price for the Holocaust. That&#8217;s the traditional Arab argument. This is slightly distorting the reality. The Arabs in the 1930s did their utmost to prevent Jewish emigration from Europe and reaching Palestine, which was the only safe haven available, because America, Britain, France, nobody wanted Jews anywhere, and they were being persecuted in Central Europe and eventually would be massacred in large numbers. So the Arab effort to pressure the British to prevent Jews reaching Palestine&#8217;s safe shores contributed indirectly to the slaughter of many Jews in Europe because they couldn&#8217;t get to anywhere, and they couldn&#8217;t get to Palestine because the Arabs were busy attacking Jews in Palestine and attacking the British to make sure they didn&#8217;t allow Jews to reach this safe haven. That&#8217;s important.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The second thing is, of course, there&#8217;s no point in belittling the fact that the Palestinian Arab National Movement&#8217;s leader, Husseini, worked for the Nazis in the 1940s. He got a salary from the German foreign ministry, he raised troops among Muslims in Bosnia for the SS, and he broadcast to the Arab world calling for the murder of the Jews in the Middle East. This is what he did. And the Arabs since then have been trying to whitewash Husseini&#8217;s role. I&#8217;m not saying he was the instigator of the Holocaust, but he helped the Germans along in doing what they were doing and supported them in doing that. So this can&#8217;t be removed from the fact that the Arabs, as you say, paid a price for the Holocaust, but they also participated in various ways in helping it happen.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">In the Palestinian case, their opposition to Jewish immigration was to prevent the transformation of their homeland into a Jewish state that would dispossess them, and I think that&#8217;s an important distinction to make. The other point I wanted to make is we&#8217;ve spent the past several hours talking about Zionism, transfer, and so on, but I think there&#8217;s a more fundamental aspect to this, which is that Zionism, I think, would have emerged and disappeared as yet one more utopian political project had it not been for the British, what the preeminent Palestinian historian, Walid Khalidi, has termed the British Shield, because I think without the British sponsorship, we wouldn&#8217;t be having this discussion today. The British sponsored Zionism for a very simple reason, which is that during World War I, the Ottoman armies attempted to march on the Suez Canal.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Suez Canal was the jugular vein of the British Empire between Europe and India, and the British came to the conclusion that they needed to secure the Suez Canal from any threat. And as the British have done so often in so many places, how do you deal with this? Well, you bring in a foreign minority, implant them amongst a hostile population, and establish a protectorate over them. I don&#8217;t think a Jewish state in Palestine had been part of British intentions, and the Balfour Declaration very specifically speaks about a Jewish national home in Palestine, in other words, a British protectorate. Things ended up taking a different course, and I think the most important development was World War II, and I think this had maybe less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the effective bankruptcy of the United Kingdom during that war, and its inability to sustain its global empire.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It ended up giving up India, ended up giving up Palestine, and it&#8217;s in that context, I think, that we need to see the emergence of a Jewish state in Palestine, and again, a Jewish state means a state in which the Jewish community enjoys not only a demographic majority, but an uncontestable demographic majority, an uncontestable territorial hegemony, and uncontestable political supremacy. And that is also why after 1948, the nascent Israeli state confiscated, I believe, up to 90% of lands that had been previously owned by Palestinians who became citizens of Israel.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">It is why the new Israeli state imposed a military government on its population of Palestinian citizens between 1948 and 1966. It is why the Israeli state effectively reduced the Palestinians living within the Israeli state, as citizens of the Israeli state, to second class citizens, on the one hand, promoting Jewish nationalism and Jewish nationalist parties, on the other hand, doing everything within its power to suppress and eliminate Palestinian or Arab nationalist movements. And that&#8217;s why today there&#8217;s a consensus among all major human rights organizations that Israel is an apartheid state, what the Israeli human rights organization B&#8217;Tselem describes a regime of Jewish supremacy between the river and the sea.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">On the question of the responsibility of the Palestinian Arabs for the Nazi Holocaust, direct or indirect, I consider that an absurd claim, as [inaudible 01:46:46] said, and I quoted him, &#8220;The entire Western world turned its back on the Jews to somehow focus on the Palestinians,&#8221; it strikes me as completely ridiculous. Number two, as Mouin said, there&#8217;s a perfectly understandable reason why Palestinian Arabs wouldn&#8217;t want Jews because in their minds, and not irrationally, these Jews intended to create a Jewish state, which would quite likely have resulted in their expulsion. I&#8217;m a very generous person. I&#8217;ve actually taken in a homeless person for two and a half years, but if I knew in advance that that homeless person was going to try to turn me out of my apartment, I would think 10,000 times before I took him in.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">As far as the actual complicity of the Palestinian Arabs, if you look at Raul Hilberg&#8217;s three volume classic work, The Destruction of the European Jury, he has in those 1,000+ pages, one sentence on the role of the mufti of Jerusalem, and that I think is probably an overstatement, but we&#8217;ll leave it aside. The only two points I would make aside from the Holocaust point is number one, I do think the transfer discussion is useful because it indicates that there was a rational reason behind the Arab resistance to Jewish or Zionist immigration to Palestine, the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I&#8217;ll stick to the history, not the current propaganda. 1917, the Zionist movement began way before the British supported the Zionist movement for decades. In 1917, the British jumped in and issued the Balfour Declaration supporting the emergence of a Jewish national home in Palestine, which most people understood to mean eventual Jewish statehood in Palestine. Most people understood that in Britain and among the Zionists and among the Arabs, but the British declared the Balfour Declaration or issued the Balfour Declaration, not only because of imperial self-interest, and this is what you&#8217;re basically saying, they had the imperial interests, a buffer state which would protect the Suez Canal from the East. The British also were motivated by idealism, and this incidentally is how Balfour described the reasoning behind issuing the declaration. And he said, &#8220;The Western world, Western Christendom owes the Jews a great debt,&#8221; both for giving the world and the West, if you like, social values as embodied in the Bible, social justice and all sorts of other things.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the Christian world owes the Jews because it persecuted them for 2,000 years. This debt we&#8217;re now beginning to repay with the 1917 declaration favoring Zionism, but it&#8217;s also worth remembering that the Jews weren&#8217;t proxies or attached to the British imperial endeavor. They were happy to receive British support in 1917 and then subsequently when the British ruled Palestine for 20, 30 years, but they weren&#8217;t part of the British imperial design or mission. They wanted a state for themselves. The Jews happy to have the British support them, happy to date to have the Americans support Israel, but it&#8217;s not because we&#8217;re stooges or extensions of American imperial interests. The British incidentally always described in Arab narratives of propaganda as consistent supporters of Zionism, they weren&#8217;t. The first British rulers in Palestine, 1917, 1920-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">No, before Herbert Samuel. Samuel came in 1920. The British ruled there for three years previously, and most of the leaders, the British generals and so on who were in Palestine were anti-Zionists. And subsequently, in the &#8217;20s and &#8217;30s, the British occasionally curbed Zionist immigration to Palestine, and in 1939 switched horses and supported the Arab National Movement and not Zionism. They turned anti-Zionist and basically said, &#8220;You Arabs will rule Palestine within the next 10 years. This is what we&#8217;re giving you by limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine,&#8221; but the Arabs didn&#8217;t actually understand what they were being given on the silver platter Husseini again, and he said, &#8220;No, no, we can&#8217;t accept the British White Paper of May 1939, which had given the Arabs everything they wanted basically, self- determination in an Arab majority state. So, what I&#8217;m saying is the British at some point did support the Zionist enterprise, but at other points were less consistent in the support. And in 1939 until 1948, when they didn&#8217;t vote even for partition for Jewish statehood in Palestine in the UN resolution, they didn&#8217;t support Zionism during the last decade of the mandate. It&#8217;s worth remembering that.</span>

It was clearly a British imperial venture, and if there had been no threat to the Suez Canal during World War I, regardless of what Balfour would&#8217;ve thought about the Jews and their contribution to history and their persecution and so on, there would&#8217;ve been no Balfour Declaration.</span>

That&#8217;s why they used the term Jewish national home. I think what they wanted was a British protectorate, loyal to and dependent upon the British. I think an outstanding review of British policy towards these issues during the mandate has been done by Martin Bunton of the University of Victoria, and he basically makes the argument that once the British realized the mess they were in, certainly by the late &#8217;20s, early &#8217;30s, they recognized the mess they were in, the irreconcilable differences, and basically pursued a policy of just muddling on, and muddling on in the context of British rule in Palestine, whose overall purpose was to serve for the development of Zionist institutions, Yishuv&#8217;s economy and so on, meant even if the British were not self-consciously doing this, preparing the groundwork for the eventual establishment of the Jewish state.

Let me ask sort of a pointed question. Was October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel genocidal? Was it an act of ethnic cleansing? Just so we lay out the moral calculus that we are engaged in, maybe-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The problem with October 7th is this, the Hamas fighters who invaded Southern Israel were sent, ordered to murder, rape, and do all the nasty things that they did, and they killed some 1,200 Israelis that day and abducted them as we know, something like 250, mostly civilians, also some soldiers, took them back to dungeons in Gaza, but they were motivated not just by the words of their current leader in the Gaza Strip, but by their ideology, which is embedded in their charter from 1988, if I remember correctly, and that charter is genocidal. It says that the Jews must be eradicated basically from the land of Israel, from Palestine. The Jews are described there as sons of apes and pigs. The Jews are a base people, killers of prophets, and they should not exist in Palestine. It doesn&#8217;t say that they necessarily should be murdered all around the world, the Hamas charter, but certainly the Jews should be eliminated from Palestine.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And this is the driving ideology behind the massacre of the Jews on October 7th, which brought down on the Gaza Strip, and I think with the intention by the Hamas of the Israeli counter offensive because they knew that that counter offensive would result in many Palestinian dead because the Hamas fighters and their weaponry and so on were embedded in the population in Gaza, and they hoped to benefit from this in the eyes of world public opinion as Israel chased these Hamas people and their ammunition dumps and so on and killed lots of Palestinian civilians in the process. All of this was understood by Sinwar, by the head of the Hamas, and he strived for that, but initially he wanted to kill as many Jews as he could in the border areas around the Gaza Strip.</span>

So again, genocidal, well, if that term is going to be discussed, my first response would be let&#8217;s talk about potentially genocidal actions against Israelis rather than against Jews for the reasons that I just mentioned.

            <span class="ts-text">Secondly, I think there are quite a few indications in the factual record that raise serious questions about the accusations of the genocidal intent and genocidal practice of what happened on October 7th.

            <span class="ts-text">Of genocide during this conflict, whether by Palestinians on October 7th or Israel thereafter, and the reason that we need such an investigation is because Hamas is&#8230; There won&#8217;t be any hearings on what Hamas did on October 7th at the International Court of Justice because the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide deals only with states and not with movements. I think the international criminal court, and specifically its current prosecutor, Karim Khan lacks any and all credibility. He&#8217;s been an absolute failure at his job. He&#8217;s just been sitting his backside for years on this file. And I think I would point out that Hamas has called for independent investigations of all these allegations. Israel has categorically rejected any international investigation, of course, fully supported by the United States. And I think what is required is to have credible investigations of these things because I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re going to convince me, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to convince you, and this is two people sitting across the table from each other.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Do you know why the number went down? The number went down because the Israeli authorities were in possession of 200 corpses that were burned to a crisp that they assumed were Israelis who had been killed on October 7th.

            <span class="ts-text">No, you&#8217;re mixing two things. Some of the bodies, they weren&#8217;t able to identify, and eventually they ruled that some of them were actually Arab marauders rather than Israeli victims. A few of them also of the Jews were burnt to a crisp and it took them time to work this out, and they came out initially with a slightly higher figure, 1,400 dead, and eventually reduced it to 1,200 dead Israelis-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the reason is that a proportion of Israeli civilians killed on October 7th&#8230; I don&#8217;t believe it was a majority. We don&#8217;t know how many.

So, this is what you have to say about Israel&#8217;s invasion of Lebanon in 1982. You said, &#8220;Israel was reluctant to harm civilians, sought to avoid casualties on both sides, and took care not to harm Lebanese and Palestinian civilians.&#8221; You then went on to acknowledge the massive use of IDF firepower against civilians during the Siege of Beirut which traumatized Israeli society. Morris quickly enters the caveat that Israel &#8220;tried to pinpoint military targets, but inevitably many civilians were hit.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That&#8217;s your description of the Lebanon War. As I say, that&#8217;s when I first got involved in the conflict. I am a voracious reader. I read everything on the Lebanon War. I would say there&#8217;s not a single account of the Lebanon War in which the estimates are between 15 and 20,000 Palestinian, Lebanese were killed, overwhelmingly civilians, the biggest bloodletting until the current Gaza genocide. Biggest bloodletting. I would say I can&#8217;t think of a single mainstream account that remotely approximates what you just said. So leaving aside&#8230; I can name the books. Voluminous, huge volumes. I&#8217;ll just take one example. Now you will remember, because I think you served in Lebanon in &#8217;82. Am I correct on that?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Can I respond to something relating to that, the Lebanon War? I looked at the book that he got this from and what the quote was from. It sounds cold to say it, but war is tragic and civilians die. There is no war that this has not happened in, in the history of all of humankind. The statement that Israel might take care not to target civilians is not incompatible with a diary entry from someone who said they saw civilians getting killed. I think that sometimes we do a lot of weird games when we talk about international humanitarian law or laws that govern conflict, but we say things like, civilians dying is a war crime, or civilian homes or hospitals getting destroyed is necessarily a war crime, or is necessarily somebody intentionally targeting civilians without making distinctions between military targets or civilian ones.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think that when we analyze different attacks or when we talk about the conduct of the military, it&#8217;s important to understand, prospectively from the unit of analysis of the actual military committing the acts, what&#8217;s happening and what are the decisions being made rather than just saying retrospectively, &#8220;Oh, well, a lot of civilians died. Not very many military people died, comparatively speaking, so it must have been war crimes,&#8221; especially when you&#8217;ve got another side, I&#8217;ll fast-forward to Hamas, that intentionally attempts to induce those same civilian numbers, because Hamas is guilty of any war crime that you would potentially accuse. And this is according to the Amnesty International, people that Norm loves to cite, Hamas is guilty of all of these same war crimes, of them failing to take care of their civilian population, of them essentially utilizing human shields to try to fire rockets, free from attacks-</span>

In regards to the Great March of Return, they said, &#8220;While the vast majority of protestors have acted in a peaceful manner, during most protests dozens have approached the fence attempting to damage it, burning fires, throwing stones and Molotov cocktails towards Israeli forces, and flying incendiary kites and balloons into Israeli territory. The latter resulted in extensive damage to agricultural land and nature reserves inside Israel and risked the lives of Israeli civilians. Some incidents of shooting and throwing of explosives also reported-&#8220;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Is there a genocide going on in Gaza? Well, in several years we will have a definitive response to that question. What has happened thus far is that on the 29th of December, the Republic of South Africa instituted proceedings against Israel, pursuant to the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide. South Africa basically accused Israel of perpetrating genocide in the Gaza Strip. On the 26th of January, the court issued its initial ruling. The court at this stage is not making a determination on whether Israel has or has not committed genocide. So, just as it has not found Israel guilty, it certainly also hasn&#8217;t found Israel innocent. What the court had to do at this stage was take one of two decisions, either South Africa&#8217;s case was the equivalent of a frivolous lawsuit and dismiss it and close the proceedings, or it had to determine that South Africa presented a plausible case that Israel was violating its obligations under the genocide convention and that it would on that basis hold a full hearing.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Now, a lot of people have looked at the court&#8217;s ruling of the 26th of January and focused on the fact that the court did not order a ceasefire. I actually wasn&#8217;t expecting it to order a ceasefire, and I wasn&#8217;t surprised that it didn&#8217;t because in the other cases that the court has considered, most prominently Bosnia and Myanmar, it also didn&#8217;t order a ceasefire, and South Africa in requesting a ceasefire also didn&#8217;t ask the court to render an opinion on the legitimacy, or lack thereof, of Israel&#8217;s military operation. From my perspective, the key issue on the 26th of January was whether the court would simply dismiss the case or decide to proceed with it.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So, the reason I raised the South African application is twofold. Hamas or no Hamas, it&#8217;s exceptionally detailed on the question of intent. And secondly, when the International Court of Justice issues a ruling, individual justices have the right can give their own opinion. And I found the German one to be the most interesting on this specific question because he was basically saying that he didn&#8217;t think South Africa presented a persuasive case, but he said their section on intent was so overpowering that he felt he was left with no choice but to vote with the majority. So, I think that answers the intent part of your question.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">So, for the ICJ case that South Africa has brought, I think there&#8217;s a couple of things that need to be mentioned.

            <span class="ts-text">Sure, so this was taken from the South African complaint. There&#8217;s tons of these, so here&#8217;s one. In the complaint for the ICJ they said that, &#8220;On the 12th of October, 2023, President Isaac Herzog made clear that Israel was not distinguishing between militants and civilians in Gaza, stating in a press conference to foreign media in relation to Palestinians in Gaza, over 1 million of whom are children, &#8216;It&#8217;s an entire nation out there that is responsible.

It&#8217;s not true, this rhetoric about civilians not being aware, not involved, it&#8217;s absolutely not true. They could have risen up, they could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in a coup d&#8217;etat, but we are at war. We are defending our homes, we are protecting our homes. That&#8217;s the truth. And when a nation protects its home, it fights and we will fight until we break their backbone.&#8221; He acknowledged that many Gazans had nothing to do with Hamas, but was adamant that others did. &#8220;I agree there are many innocent Palestinians who don&#8217;t agree with this, but you have a missile in your goddamn kitchen and you want to shoot it at me. Am I allowed to defend myself? We have to defend ourselves. We have the right to do so.&#8221;</span>

            <span class="ts-text">This is not the same as saying there&#8217;s no distinction between militants and civilians in Gaza. His statement here is actually fully compliant with international law to the letter because if you are storing military supplies in civilian areas, these things become military targets, and you&#8217;re allowed to do proportionality assessments afterwards. So, if this is supposed to be one of many quotes that they&#8217;ve shown that is supposed to demonstrate genocidal intent, but it is very easily explained by military intent or by a conflict between two parties-</span>

I couldn&#8217;t believe the comprehensiveness of that particular report. Number two, there are two quite respected judges&#8230; Excuse me, there were two quite respected experts of international law sitting on the South African panel, John Dugard and Vaughan Lowe. Vaughan Lowe, as you might know, he argued the war case in 2004 before the International Court of Justice. Now, they were alleging genocide, which in their view means the evidence in their minds&#8230;</span>

I would say they make a very strong case, but let&#8217;s agree plausible. Now, here&#8217;s a question, if somebody qualifies for an Olympic team, let&#8217;s say a regional person qualifies for an Olympic team, it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re going to be on the Olympic team, it doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re going to win a gold medal, a silver medal, or a bronze medal-</span>

It&#8217;s a misrepresentation of the strength of the case against Israel, just like the majority of the quotes they have in this case are. And also you said it was an extremely well-founded case.

            <span class="ts-text">So first of all, thank you for that heated discussion about the present. I would love to go back into history in a way that informs what we can look for as by way of hope for the future. So when has Israel and Palestine have we been closest to something like a peace settlement, to something that where both sides would be happy and enable the flourishing of both peoples?</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ts-segment">
            <span class="ts-name">Benny Morris</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, from my knowledge of the 120 years or so of conflict, the closest I think the two sides have been to reaching some sort of settlement appears to have been in the year 2000 when Barak and then subsequently Clinton offered a two-state settlement to PLO, Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and Arafat seemed to waver. He didn&#8217;t immediately reject what was being offered, but ultimately at the end of Camp David in July 2000, he came down against the proposals. And Clinton who said he wouldn&#8217;t blame him, later blamed Arafat for bringing down the summit and not reaching a solution there. But I think there on the table, certainly in the Clinton parameters of December 2000, which followed the proposals by Barak in July, the Palestinians were offered the best deal they&#8217;re ever going to get from Israel unless Israel is destroyed and then there&#8217;ll just be a Palestinian Arab state.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But the best deal that Israel could ever offer them, they were offered, which essentially was 95% of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, half of the old city of Jerusalem, some sort of joint control of the Temple Mount and the Gaza Strip of course in full. And the Palestinians said no to this deal and nobody really knows why Arafat said no. Some people think he was trying to hold out for slightly better terms, but my reading is that he was constitutionally, psychologically incapable of signing off on a two-state deal, meaning acceptance of the existence of a Jewish state. This was really the problem.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Of a Jewish state, the Jewish state of Israel. He wasn&#8217;t willing to share Palestine with the Jews and put his name to that. I think he just couldn&#8217;t do it. That&#8217;s my reading. But some people say it was because the terms were insufficient and he was willing, but was waiting for slightly better terms. I don&#8217;t buy that. I don&#8217;t think so. But other people disagree with me on this.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, just briefly in response, Arafat formally recognized Israel in 1993. Yeah, earlier. I don&#8217;t think actually that in 2000-2001, a genuine resolution was on offer because I think the maximum Israel was prepared to offer, admittedly more than it had been prepared to offer in the past, fell short of the minimum that the Palestinians consider to be a reasonable two state settlement. Bearing in mind that as of 1949, Israel controlled 78% of the British mandate of Palestine. Palestinians were seeking a state on the remaining 22%, and this was apparently too much for Israel. My response to your question would be-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Hussein Araj, yes, who was not at Camp David. But in response to your question, I think there could have been a real possibility of Israeli-Palestinian and Arab-Israeli peace in the mid 1970s in the wake of the 1973 October War. I&#8217;ll recall that in 1971, Moshe Dayan, Israel&#8217;s defense minister at the time, full of triumphalism about Israel&#8217;s victory in 1967 speaking to a group of Israeli military veterans, stated, &#8220;If I had to choose between Sharm El-Sheikh without peace or peace without Sharm El-Sheikh&#8230;&#8221; This is referring to the resort in Egyptian Sinai, which was an under Israeli occupation. Dayan said, &#8220;I will choose for Sharm El-Sheikh without peace.&#8221; Then the 1973 war came along and I think Israeli calculations began to change very significantly.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And I think it was in that context that had there been a joint US-Soviet push for an Arab-Israeli and Israeli-Palestinian resolution that incorporated both an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines and the establishment of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories, I think there was a very reasonable prospect for that being achieved. It ended up being aborted, I think for several reasons, and ultimately the Egyptian President Anwar Sadat decided for reasons we can discuss later to launch a separate unilateral initiative for Israeli Egyptian rather than Arab-Israeli peace. And I think once that set in motion, the prospects disappeared because Israel essentially saw its most powerful adversary removed from the equation and felt that this would give it a free hand in the occupied territories also in Lebanon to get rid of the PLO and so on.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You ask when were we closest, and I can&#8217;t give you an answer of when we were closest. I can only tell you when I think we could have been close and that was a lost opportunity. If we look at the situation today, there&#8217;s been a lot of discussion about a two-state settlement. My own view, and I&#8217;ve written about this, I don&#8217;t buy the arguments of the naysayers that we have passed the so-called point of no return with respect to a two-state settlement. Certainly if you look at the Israeli position in the occupied territories, I would argue it&#8217;s more tenuous than was the French position in Algeria in 1954, than was a British position in Ireland in 1916, than was a Ethiopian position in Eritrea in 1990. And so as a matter of practicality, as a matter of principle, I do think the establishment of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories remains realistic.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think the question that we now need to ask ourselves, it&#8217;s one I&#8217;m certainly asking myself since October 7th and looking at Israel&#8217;s genocidal campaign, but also looking at larger questions, is it desirable? Can you have peace with what increasingly appears to be an irrational genocidal state that seeks to confront and resolve each and every political challenge with violence? And that reacts to its failure to achieve solutions to political challenges with violence by applying even more violence, that has an insatiable lust for Palestinian territory, that a genocidal apartheid state that seems increasingly incapable of even conceiving of peaceful coexistence with the other people on that land. So I&#8217;m very pessimistic that a solution is possible.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I grew up in Western Europe in the long shadow of the Second World War. I think we can all agree that there could have been no peace in Europe had certain regimes on that continent not been removed from power. I look at Southeast Asia in the late 1970s, and I think we all agreed that there could not have been peace that region had the Khmer Rouge not been ousted. I look at Southern Africa during the 1990s and I think we can all be agreed that had the white minority regimes that ruled Zimbabwe and South Africa not been dismantled, there could not have been peace in that region. And although I think it&#8217;s worth having a discussion, I do think it&#8217;s now legitimate question to ask, can there be peace without dismantling the Zionist regime?</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And I make a very clear distinction between the Israeli state and its institutions on the one hand and the Israeli people who I think regardless of our discussion about the history, I think you can now talk about an Israeli people and the people that have developed rights over time and a formula for peaceful coexistence with them will need to be found, which is a separate matter from dismantling the Israeli state and its institutions. And again, I haven&#8217;t reached clear conclusions about this except to say as a practical matter, I think a two state settlement remains feasible. But I think there are very legitimate questions about its desirability and about whether peace can be achieved in the Middle East with the persistence of an irrational genocidal apartheid regime. Particularly because Israeli society is beginning to develop many extremely, extremely distasteful supremacist, dehumanizing aspects that I think also stand in the way of coexistence that are being fed by this regime.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I feel like in 2000, I feel like the deal that was present, at least at the end of the Taba Summit, I think in terms of what Israel, I think had the appetite to give and what the Palestinians would&#8217;ve gotten, would&#8217;ve definitely been the most agreeable between the two parties. I don&#8217;t know if in &#8217;73. I&#8217;m not sure if the appetite would&#8217;ve ever been there for the Arab states to negotiate alongside the Palestinians. I know that in Jordan there was no love for the Palestinians after 1970, after Black September. I know that Sadat had no love for the Palestinians due to their association with the Muslim brotherhoods, attempted assassinations in Egypt.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Admittedly, he says as much, belongs to a [inaudible 03:42:05] group, not PLO directly. But I think that there was a history of the Palestinians sometimes fighting with their neighboring states that were hosting them if they weren&#8217;t getting the political concessions they wanted. The assassination of the Jordanian king in &#8217;51 might be another example of that in Jordan. It feels like over a long period of time, it feels like the Palestinians have been told from the neighboring Arab states that if they just continue to enact violence, whether in Israel or abroad, that eventually a state will materialize somehow. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s gotten them any closer to a state. If anything, I think it&#8217;s taken them farther and farther and farther away from one, and I think as long as the hyperbolic language is continually employed internationally, the idea that Israel is committing a genocide, the idea that there is an apartheid, the idea that they live in a concentration camp, all of these words, I think further the narrative for the Palestinians that Israel is an evil state that needs to be dismantled.</span>

All of the other surrounding Arab states have accepted that, or at least most of them down in the Gulf. Egypt and Jordan have accepted that the Palestinians need to accept it too. The Israeli state or the state apparatus is not going anywhere, and at some point they need to realize like, &#8220;Hey, we need a leader that&#8217;s going to come out and represent us, represent all of us, is willing to take political risks, is willing to negotiate some lasting piece for us, and it&#8217;s not going to be the international community or some invocation of international law or some invocation of morality or justice that&#8217;s going to extricate us from this conflict.

But I don&#8217;t agree incidentally with this definition of Israel or the Israeli state as apartheid. It&#8217;s not. There is some sort of apartheid going on in the West Bank.

            <span class="ts-text">But I&#8217;m just saying, let&#8217;s not bog down on that. The war is over and when President Carter comes into power&#8230; Carter was an extremely smart guy. Jimmy Carter, extremely smart guy, and he was very fixed on details. He was probably the most impressive of modern American presidents, in my opinion, by a wide margin. And he was determined to resolve the conflict on a big scale, on the Arab-Israeli scale. On the Palestinian issue, he wouldn&#8217;t go past what he called a Palestinian homeland.

            <span class="ts-text">On the Palestinian national home. He wouldn&#8217;t go as far as a Palestinian state. I&#8217;m not going to go into the details of that. I don&#8217;t think realistically, given the political balance of forces that was going to happen, but that&#8217;s a separate issue. Let&#8217;s get to the issue at hand, namely, what is the obstacle or what has been the obstacle since the early 1970s? Since roughly 1974, the Palestinians have accepted the two states settlement and the June 1967 border. Now as more pressure was exerted on Israel because the Palestinians seemed reasonable, the Israelis, to quote the Israeli political scientist, Avner Yaniv, he since passed from the scene. He said&#8230; Yaniv in his book, Dilemmas of Security, he said that the big Israeli fear was what he called the Palestinian peace offensive.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">That was their worry that the Palestinians were becoming too moderate. And unless you understand that, you can&#8217;t understand the June 1982 Lebanon war. The purpose of the June 1982 Lebanon war was to liquidate the PLO in Southern Lebanon because they were too moderate the Palestinian peace offensive. I&#8217;m going to have to fast-forward. There are many events. There was the First Intifada, then there&#8217;s the Oslo Accord, and let&#8217;s now go to the heart of the issue, namely the 2000-2001 negotiations. Well, the negotiations are divided into three parts for the sake of listeners. There&#8217;s Camp David in July 2000, there are the Clinton parameters in December 2000, and then there are negotiations in Taba in Egypt in 2001. Those are the three phases. Now, I have studied the record probably to the point of insanity because there are so many details you have to master.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Actually, I will vouch for it. I will personally vouch for it. There is one extensive record from that whole period, from 2000 to you could say 2007, and that is what came to be called the Palestine Papers, which were about 15,000 pages of all the records of the negotiations. I have read through all of them, every single page, and this is what I find. If you look at Shlomo Ben-Ami&#8217;s book, which I have with me, Prophets Without Honor, it&#8217;s his last book. He says, &#8220;Going into Camp David&#8230;&#8221; That means July, going into Camp David, July 2000, he said the Israelis were willing to return about&#8230; Not return.

I think the international community in its political incarnation, the General Assembly, the Security Council, all those UN Security Council resolutions saying the settlements are illegal, annexation of East Jerusalem is null and void, and the International Court of Justice, that, to me, is a reasonable standard. And by that standard, the Palestinians were asked to make concessions, which I consider unreasonable or the international community considers unreasonable.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I think that the issue is when you apply international law or international standards, I wouldn&#8217;t say what Benny Morris says, that they&#8217;re irrelevant, but I think that these have to be seen as informing the conversation. I don&#8217;t think these are the final shape of the conversation. I don&#8217;t think, historically, Israel has ever negotiated within the strict bounds of whether we&#8217;re talking Resolution 242, whether we&#8217;re talking about any General Assembly resolutions. That&#8217;s just not how these negotiations tend to go.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">You might consider international opinion on things, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s the bilateral negotiations, oftentimes historically started in secret, independent of the international community, that end up shaping what the final agreements look like. I think the issue with this broad appeal to international law is, again, going back to my earlier point about all of the euphemistic words, all it simply does is drive Palestinian expectations up to a level that is never going to be satisfied. For instance, you can throw that ICJ opinion all you want, it was an advisory opinion, that came in 2004, how Palestinians gained more or less land since that 2004 advisory opinion was issued.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And just as a matter of historical record, beginning in the early 1970s, there was fierce debate within the Palestinian national movement about whether to accept or reject. And there were three schools of thought. There was one that would accept nothing less than the total liberation of Palestine. There was a second that accepted what was called the establishment of a fighting national authority on Palestinian soil, which they saw-</span>

            <span class="ts-text">&#8230; as a springboard for the total liberation of Palestine. And there was a third school that believed that, under current dynamics and so on, that they should go for a two-state settlement. And our friend and correspondent [inaudible 04:09:41] has written a very perceptive article on when the PLO, already in 1976, came out in open support of a two-state resolution at the Security Council. PLO accepted it. Israel, of course, rejected it. But the resolution didn&#8217;t pass because the US and the UK vetoed it. It was both of them.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Ah, okay. Yeah. But fact of the matter is that the PLO came to accept a two-state settlement. Why they did it I think is irrelevant. And subsequently, the PLO acted on the basis of seeking to achieve a two-state settlement. The reason, I think, and I think Norm, you&#8217;ve written about this, the reason that Arafat was so insistent on getting minimally acceptable terms for a two-state settlement at Camp David and afterwards was precisely because he knew that once he signed, that was all the Palestinians were going to get. If his intention had been, &#8220;I&#8217;m not accepting Israel. I simply want to springboard,&#8221; he would&#8217;ve accepted a Palestinian state in Jericho, but he didn&#8217;t.

            <span class="ts-text">But for some reason, they&#8217;ve never had a leader that convinced them of that as much, that Arafat thought that if he held on, there was always a better deal around the corner, that Abbas is more concerned with trying to maintain any legitimacy amongst Palestinians than actually trying to negotiate anything realistic with Israel, that Palestinians are always incentivized to feel like as long as they keep fighting, either the international community is going to save them with the 5 millionth UN resolution condemning whatever, that another ICJ advisory opinion is finally going to lead to the expulsion of half a million Jews from the West Bank, or that some other international body, the ICJ and the genocide charge, is going to come and save the Palestinians.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">As long as they, in their mind, feel like somebody is coming to save them, then they feel like they&#8217;re going to have the ability to get something better in the future. But the reality is all of the good partners for peace that the Palestinians had have completely and utterly abandoned them; Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf states. Whether you&#8217;re talking bilateral peace or the Abraham Accords, most of the Arab leaders, in negotiating peace with Israel, have just not had as much of an interest in maintaining the rights and the representations of what the Palestinian people want.</span>

And the reality is, we can scream until we&#8217;re blue in the face on these things, none of it has gotten any closer to helping the Palestinians in any sense of the word.</span>

Because I think, over time, the mounting pressure from without the international community and the mounting pressure from within because Israel hosts a lot of its own criticism, if we talk about B&#8217;Tselem, we talk about Haaretz, Israel will host a lot of its own criticism.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">The problem is, as Benny said, yeah, it&#8217;s difficult because Hamas enjoys so much widespread support amongst the Palestinian people.

            <span class="ts-text">And then when the international pressure is always &#8217;67 borders, infinite right of return for refugees, and a total withdrawal of Israel from all these lands to even start negotiations, I just don&#8217;t see, realistically, on the Palestinian side, no negotiations are ever going to start in a place that Israel&#8217;s willing to accept.</span>

Of course, they could have been more effective. Everyone could have always been more effective.

            <span class="ts-text">Yeah, you&#8217;re correct. Several of them, most importantly, Egypt, Jordan, have made their peace with Israel. I should add that Israel&#8217;s conduct since then has placed these relations under strain. I had very little&#8230; I didn&#8217;t take the reports of a Saudi-Israeli rapprochement particularly seriously before October 7th, the reason being that it was really a Saudi-Israeli-US deal, which committed the US to make certain commitments to Saudi Arabia that would probably never get through Congress.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">I don&#8217;t think the question is whether that deal is legitimate or not. I think that deal exists. But the point is, the core of this conflict is not between Israel and Egypt. The core of this conflict is between Israel and the Palestinian people.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">And the reason that Israel agreed to relinquish the occupied Egyptian Sinai and the reason that Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty was signed in 1979 is because Israel, in 1973, recognized that its military superiority was ultimately no match for Egypt&#8217;s determination to recover its occupied territories and that there would come a point when Egypt would find a way to extract an unbearable price.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">Well, first of all, I would agree with Benny Morris and Norman Finkelstein that the current situation is bleak, and I think it would be unreasonable to expect it to not get even bleaker in the coming weeks and months. And we now, this conflict, really, it originated in the late 19th century, it&#8217;s been a more or less active conflict since the 1920s, 1930s, and it has produced a tremendous amount of suffering, and regional conflict, and geopolitical complications, and all of that. But what gives me hope is that throughout their entire ordeal, the Palestinian people have never surrendered, and I believe they never will surrender to overwhelming force and violence. They have taken everything that Israel has thrown at them, they have taken everything that the West has thrown at them, they have taken everything that those who are supposed to be their natural allies have on occasion thrown at them.</span>

            <span class="ts-text">But this is a people that never has and, I believe, never will surrender.

My issue is that I feel like we have jumped on this euphemistic treadmill, and I think that&#8217;s part of the reason why this conflict will never get solved, is because on one end you&#8217;ve got a people who are now convinced internationally that they&#8217;re victims of apartheid, genocide, concentration camp conditions, ethnic cleansing, they&#8217;re forced to live in an open air prison, with all of these things that are stacked against them, all of these terms that are highly specific, that refer to very precise things.

            <span class="ts-text">I think there&#8217;s a value to preserving the record. I&#8217;m not optimistic about where things are going to end up. There was a very nice book written by a woman named Helen Hunt Jackson at the end of the 19th century, describing what was done to the Native Americans. She called it a century of dishonor, and she described in vivid, poignant detail what was done to the Native Americans. Did it save them? No. Did it help them? Probably not. Did it preserve their memory? Yes, and I think there&#8217;s a value to that. There was a famous film by Sergei Eisenstein, it was either Battleship Potemkin or Mother, I can&#8217;t remember which one. The last scene was the Tsar&#8217;s troops mowing down all the Russian people. He pans the scene.</span>
